# Frontend Mentor - Social Media Dashboard with Theme Switcher Solution

This is a solution to the [Social media dashboard with theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H). This challenge helped improve my skills in responsive design, React component architecture, and implementing dark/light theme toggling.

## My Process

### Built With

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
* Flexbox and CSS Grid
* Mobile-first workflow
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) (for backend authentication and database)
* [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) font – weights 400 & 700

### What I Learned

* Dynamic theme switching using Tailwind’s dark mode
* Implementing Supabase auth and protecting routes with middleware
* Using local JSON files for data and managing state
* Optimizing reusable components and conditional rendering
* Tailwind's utility classes for letter-spacing (`tracking-wide`, etc.)

### Continued Development

I’d like to continue improving in these areas:

* Better handling of Supabase error states and loading feedback
* Implementing more robust route protection and role-based access
* Moving towards full-stack with Supabase — analytics, CRUD, etc.
